# Application Name: 

Subscription Hub

# Project Topic/Objective: 

My web application will serve as a subscription manager. The objective of my web application is to store information (name of subscription, price, term of subscription, start/end of subscription) of userâ€™s subscriptions. The user will be able to add as many subscriptions as they like and will be able to delete them when they no longer have a particular subscription. The user will be able to keep track of their subscriptions and get notifications when payments are due. The web application will also allow users to store the usernames and passwords (if applicable) for their subscriptions if they wish to do so. 

# Motivation: 

I want to build this particular application because there are so many subscription based services (Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime, Loot Crate, Stitch Fix, Blue Apron) and keeping track of all of your subscriptions can be difficult. I sometimes forget to cancel my own subscriptions when I no longer need them and I end up spending unnecessary money. My web application will help users keep track of their subscriptions all in one place. I also want to build this application because there are a lot of different web development components that I want to practice and learn from both the frontend and backend. For example, I want to practice DOM manipulation with Javascript and I want to learn how to authenticate user login information with data stored in the database.

# Server-Side Components: 

My application will store user login information in addition to subscription information in a database. There will also be authentication for user login information. Additionally there will be security for user login information and for usernames and passwords for their subscriptions if they use that feature as well.
